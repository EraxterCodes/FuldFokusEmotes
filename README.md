# FuldFokusEmotes

FuldFokusEmotes is a lightweight extension for [Twitch Emotes v2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/twitch-emotes-v2).  
It adds custom emotes used by the guild **FuldFokus** on EU‚ÄìDraenor, seamlessly integrating them into the existing TwitchEmotes framework.

Maintained by [Eraxter](https://github.com/EraxterCodes).  
All credit for the original addon goes to **Ren ‚Äì Illidan (US)** and **Jons ‚Äì MirageRaceway (EU)**.  
This addon simply injects additional emotes into their system.

## üì¶ Features

- Adds unique **FuldFokus guild emotes** alongside existing Twitch/Discord emotes.
- Full integration with:
  - **Chat replacement**: type `:EmoteName:` and see it render.
  - **Dropdown menu**: emotes appear under a new `FuldFokus` category.
  - **Autocomplete**: start typing `:Em...` and suggestions like `:EmilOk:` will show.
- Completely non-invasive: does not override or modify Twitch Emotes v2, only appends.

## Contributing

This addon is not meant as a replacement or circumvention of the original **Twitch Emotes v2**. It only exists to provide custom emotes for members of **FuldFokus**. If you would like to see more global emotes added, please consider reaching out to the original authors ‚Äî this project is only possible thanks to their excellent work.  

For members of **FuldFokus** who want to add guild-specific emotes, there are two ways to contribute:

### Option 1: Pull Request
1. Place the new `.tga` file in `Emotes/FuldFokus/`.  
   - The image **must** use dimensions that are powers of 2 (e.g. `64x64`, `128x128`).  
2. Open `FuldFokusEmotes.lua` and add the emote name to the local `EMOTES` list.  
3. Submit a Pull Request on GitHub.  

### Option 2: Discord Submission
Send me a DM on Discord with the image you‚Äôd like added.  
- Remember: the file **must** have pixel dimensions that are powers of 2 (e.g. `64x64`, `128x128`).
